# Boss Wallah Chatbot - Additional Functionalities

This file explains additional features, future improvements, and alternate configurations for the Boss Wallah Chatbot.

---

## 1️⃣ Automatic Language Detection

* We can integrate **Lingua** or any other language detection library to automatically detect the language of the input query.
* Once detected, the system can:

  1. Ask the LLM in English (or model-preferred language).
  2. Translate the LLM response back into the original input language.

This allows users to ask questions in **any language** and receive responses in the same language.

## 2️⃣ Alternative LLM Options

* Currently using **Groq LLM** (`openai/gpt-oss-20b`) for fast responses.
* Optionally, we can use **Ollama** or other LLM providers.
* Swapping LLM providers requires minimal code changes; just update the client and model parameters.

---

## 3️⃣ Database Integration

* Currently, the RAG pipeline reads data from **CSV files**.
* We can directly connect to a **database** (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for dynamic content.
* The RAG pipeline remains the same; only the data loading step changes.

## 4️⃣ Flexible Query Types

* Users can query the API in **two ways**:

1. **RAG-based query (default)**:

```json
{"query": "Tell me about Python courses"}
```

Returns response based on database content.

2. **LLM query**:

```json
{"query": "Tell me about Python courses", "type": "llm"}
```

Returns response from the LLM (`openai/gpt-oss-20b` or any configured model).

* Optionally, we can integrate **Google Custom Search** with **BeautifulSoup** to fetch updated web data and feed it to LLM for real-time answers.

---

## 5️⃣ Smart Agent Integration

* Using **LangChain agents**, the system can **automatically decide** whether to fetch the answer from the database or ask the LLM.
* Criteria could include:

  * Database coverage: if query matches database context, use RAG.
  * Freshness: if query requires latest information, use LLM + web search.

* This makes the chatbot **smarter** and more **dynamic**.
